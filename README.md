# Hey There! 😁

My name is **Cameron Tull** and I *love* to build stuff! ⚒️ 
>I enjoy building things because to build something from scratch given certain parameters requires efficient and functional design + skilled implementation. This can result in an artifact of value that will improve the experience of the stakeholders, ideally having positive environmental or systemic ripple effects to other connected systems.

I've spent most of my life in the skilled trades as a finish carpenter and woodworker but have recently grown an interest in: 
- 💻 web development and, 
+ 📈 data analytics 

I've spent some time deepening my knowledge of Computer Science through Harvard's CS50 course + I'm actively working through Codecademy's Full Stack Web-Developer Career program and DataCamp's courses. 

I intend to upload as much of my learning journey as possible. 👍 

## Why an interest in *data analytics*..

>I believe *Data* is the substance by which we can infer which habits (or actions) to take given certain goals and underlying belief systems; and how we can track progress towards desired outcomes.
  
I’ve always been a very analytical person 
  
  🤓 I make spreadsheets for fun to track habits, personal finances, run cost-benefit analysis for decisions, etc.
    
In Atomic Habits, James Clear writes, 
      
>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1% better every day counts for a lot in the long-run

💡 Great example = British cycling team breaking century+ streak of poor performance by implementing “the aggregation of marginal gains” strategy where 1% improvements in every imaginal metric = 66+ Olympic Gold medals & 5 Tour de France victories in a 10yr span.

💡 This exemplifies the power of how data can drive progress at the margins to equal unimaginal gains.

My goal is to become skilled at data analytics so as to help businesses reach similar results..
