# Welcome!

My name is **Cameron Tull** and I *love* to build stuff! ⚒️ 

I've spent most of my life in the skilled trades as a finish carpenter and woodworker but have recently grown an interest in web development and data analytics. I've spent some time deepening my knowledge of Computer Science through Harvard's CS50 course and am actively working through Codecademy's Full Stack Web-Developer Career program and DataCamp's courses. 

🎯 I intend to upload as much of my learning journey as possible.
