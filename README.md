# Hey There! 😁

My name is **Cameron Tull** and I *love* to build stuff! ⚒️ 

I've spent most of my life in the skilled trades as a finish carpenter and woodworker but have recently grown an interest in: 
- 💻 web development and, 
+ 📈 data analytics 

I've spent some time deepening my knowledge of Computer Science through Harvard's CS50 course + I'm actively working through Codecademy's Full Stack Web-Developer Career program and DataCamp's courses. 

I intend to upload as much of my learning journey as possible. 👍
